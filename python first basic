Q1: Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.

#### For Loop
Use a for loop when you know the number of iterations in advance. For loops are typically used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or to iterate a specific number of times.

**Example:**
# Printing numbers from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)


#### While Loop
Use a while loop when the number of iterations is not known beforehand. While loops continue to execute as long as a condition is true.

**Example:**
# Printing numbers from 1 to 5
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1


### Q2: Write a python program to print the sum and product of the first 10 natural numbers using for and while loop.

#### Using For Loop
# Sum and Product using for loop
sum_for = 0
product_for = 1
for i in range(1, 11):
    sum_for += i
    product_for *= i

print("Sum using for loop:", sum_for)
print("Product using for loop:", product_for)


#### Using While Loop
# Sum and Product using while loop
sum_while = 0
product_while = 1
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    sum_while += i
    product_while *= i
    i += 1

print("Sum using while loop:", sum_while)
print("Product using while loop:", product_while)


### Q3: Create a python program to compute the electricity bill for a household.

def calculate_electricity_bill(units):
    if units <= 100:
        bill = units * 4.5
    elif units <= 200:
        bill = 100 * 4.5 + (units - 100) * 6
    elif units <= 300:
        bill = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + (units - 200) * 10
    else:
        bill = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + 100 * 10 + (units - 300) * 20
    return bill

# Test case
units_consumed = 310
bill = calculate_electricity_bill(units_consumed)
print(f"Total electricity bill for {units_consumed} units is Rs. {bill}")


### Q4: Calculate the cube of each number from 1 to 100 and append to a list if divisible by 4 or 5.

#### Using For Loop
# For loop
numbers = list(range(1, 101))
result_for = []

for number in numbers:
    cube = number ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        result_for.append(number)

print("Numbers whose cube is divisible by 4 or 5 using for loop:", result_for)


#### Using While Loop
# While loop
numbers = list(range(1, 101))
result_while = []
i = 0

while i < len(numbers):
    cube = numbers[i] ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        result_while.append(numbers[i])
    i += 1

print("Numbers whose cube is divisible by 4 or 5 using while loop:", result_while)


### Q5: Write a program to filter and count vowels in a given string.

string = "I want to become a data scientist"
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
filtered_vowels = [char for char in string if char in vowels]
count_vowels = len(filtered_vowels)

print("Vowels in the string:", filtered_vowels)
print("Number of vowels:", count_vowels)

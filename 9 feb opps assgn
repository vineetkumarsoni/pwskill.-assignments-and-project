# Q1
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name_of_vehicle, max_speed, average_of_vehicle):
        self.name_of_vehicle = name_of_vehicle
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.average_of_vehicle = average_of_vehicle

# Q2
class Car(Vehicle):
    def seating_capacity(self, capacity):
        return f"The {self.name_of_vehicle} has a seating capacity of {capacity}."

# Q3
# Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.
class Parent1:
    def method1(self):
        print("Method 1 from Parent 1")

class Parent2:
    def method2(self):
        print("Method 2 from Parent 2")

class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
    def method3(self):
        print("Method 3 in Child class")

# Q4
# Getter and Setter methods are used to get and set the values of attributes in a class respectively.
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._my_attr = None

    def get_my_attr(self):
        return self._my_attr

    def set_my_attr(self, value):
        self._my_attr = value

# Q5
# Method overriding in Python is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided in its parent class.
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("Parent class method")

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        print("Child class method")

# Demonstrate method overriding
parent_obj = Parent()
parent_obj.show()

child_obj = Child()
child_obj.show()

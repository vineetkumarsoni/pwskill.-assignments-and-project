Q1. 
import pandas as pd

data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
series1 = pd.Series(data)
print(series1)


Q2. 
import pandas as pd

data = list(range(10))
series2 = pd.Series(data)
print(series2)


Q3. 
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Claire'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 27],
    'Gender': ['Female', 'Male', 'Female']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)


Q4. 
- **DataFrame in Pandas**: It is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It is similar to a table in a database or a spreadsheet.  
- **Difference from Pandas Series**:  
    - DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure whereas Series is a 1-dimensional data structure.  
    - DataFrame can store multiple columns of data whereas Series can store only a single column of data.

Q5. Common functions to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame:
    - .head(): Returns the first n rows.
    - .tail(): Returns the last n rows.
    - .info(): Displays basic information about the data.
    - .describe(): Generates descriptive statistics.
    - .drop(): Drops specified labels from rows or columns.
    - .groupby(): Group DataFrame using a mapper or by a Series of columns.
    
An example of usage could be:
# to get descriptive statistics on a specific column 'Age'
print(df['Age'].describe())


Q6. DataFrame is mutable in nature while Series is also mutable. Panel is considered to be less mutable. 

Q7. Creating a DataFrame using multiple Series:
import pandas as pd

# Creating multiple Series
names = pd.Series(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Claire'])
ages = pd.Series([25, 30, 27])
genders = pd.Series(['Female', 'Male', 'Female'])

# Creating a DataFrame using multiple Series
data = {'Name': names, 'Age': ages, 'Gender': genders}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)
